# java-obfuscator-benchmarks

*All obfuscators use the most agressive configurations!!*

* ZKM 21 Crack - I've noticed ZKM 21 is not horrible. Recaf shows errors but in assembly mode it doesn't, this can make easy cracks if authentication is not great or badly coded. No crasher on any decompiler though. Added extra classes to throw off someone who's trying to reverse engineer. Overall pretty hard to read without any modifications as well.

* SB27 - What can I say, for a free and old obfuscator it's not bad. Still don't use it of course, but it's not garbage. Like a lot of others, it throws errors in Recaf but in assembly mode it saves and such without any errors. Code is readable, not un-compiled java readable but still quite readable. Also adds WAY too many code comments. I would probably only use this for applications that are launchers or basic games as per the base JAR which is Snake.

*Thanks to @hexadeciman for creating the base JAR of SnakeGame!*
