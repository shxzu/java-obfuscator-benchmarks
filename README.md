# java-obfuscator-benchmarks

*All obfuscators use the most agressive configurations!!*

* ZKM 21 Crack - I've noticed ZKM 21 is not horrible. Recaf errors upon saving but in assembly mode it doesn't, this can make easy cracks if authentication is not great or badly coded. No crasher on any decompiler though. Added extra classes to throw off someone who's trying to reverse engineer. Overall pretty hard to read without any modifications as well.
